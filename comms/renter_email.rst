Subject: Pricing Evidence for 3000 Somervale Court SW #209

Hi ``[Name]``,

I prepared a pricing memo for the unit using recent comparables and
documented evidence for each key number.

Highlights:

- Proposed price: ``[fill in]``
- Defensible range: ``[fill in]``
- Method: sold comparables with adjustments for size, condition, and parking

I can send the full memo and sources for your review.

Thanks,
``[Your Name]``
